# Find

Problem Statement: 
According to reports, the average person lost nine items daily. That's nearly 3,300 (3,285) items per year, and about 60 hours lost per year, or close to 2.5 days. Over an average of 60.5 years of adult life, that's nearly 200K (198,742) items lost and 3,680 hours wasted, or over 150 days (153.3 days) in a lifetime.
The lost item might include expensive items, important documents etc.

Problem Solution: 
The FINDER app is specifically designed to increase the efficiency of finding lost items using QR codes. 
THE app comes in two parts: firstly a QR code generator and a chatting application.
The QR code generated will be pasted on the items/belongings.
The User can either use the QR code scanner that we provide or they can opt for any other available QR code scanner.
Once scanned over any item containing FINDER app QR code, the user name/user id will be displayed.
The person(who scanned the QR code), can go to our FINDER APP chatting ,and contact the user about their item, and negotiate among themselves.

Issues:
